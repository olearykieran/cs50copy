sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm performed better on large sorted lists than sort 3 which helped me deduce that it is bubble sort (omega case is n)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm outperformed the others on large random & reveresed lists

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: This algorithm performed worse on large sorted lists than sort 1 which helped me deduce that it is selection sort (omega case is n squared)
